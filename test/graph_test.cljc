  "Tests for the kami-graph restoration (see `graph`, `graph.data`, `graph.layout`).

  `force-layout-basic` ports `layout::tests::test_basic_layout` from the original
  `kami-graph/src/layout.rs` 1:1 (same graph shape, same assertions). All other
  tests are additional coverage added during the CLJC port to exercise
  `graph.data` (JSON->graph transforms), `graph.layout/pcb-layout`, and the
  `graph` instance/color/camera helpers, since the original crate only had this
  one `#[test]`."
